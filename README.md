## 🌱 About Me

I'm a self-taught developer from a creative background—currently writing a dark fantasy graphic novel and building tools that blend **code**, **narrative structure**, and **design thinking**.

To navigate complexity, I developed my own neurodivergent-friendly learning system using mind maps, colour-coded dashboards, and weekly sprints. That framework helped me:

- 🖋️ Write 10+ novel chapters  
- 🧠 Build 3 web app demos 
- 💼 Intern with a medical AI startup (React + D3)  
- ⚖️ Win a housing disrepair legal case while studying  
- 🍏 Secure a place on Apple’s Software Engineering Apprenticeship

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
**Frameworks/Tools**: React, D3, Git, Node.js, Markdown  
**Other Tools**: OneNote, ChatGPT (for systemised learning + debugging), Canva, Figma

## 🔭 Current Projects

- 🧠 **Interactive Storytelling App**  
  A narrative logic engine and visual editor built in React—designed for creators who think non-linearly.

- 🔍 **Lore Engine & Mythology System**  
  A modular data framework used to organise symbolic character traits, behavior patterns, and transformation arcs for complex worldbuilding. *(Designed to scale into apps, games, or future writing tools—Book 2 spoilers hidden for now.)*

- 🧰 **STAR+ Interview Toolkit (Open Source – WIP)**  
  A dyslexia-friendly storytelling format that helps learners express technical growth through story. (Inspired by the prep system that helped me secure the Apple role.)

## 🔁 My Learning Style

Visual-first. System-based. Emotion-aware.

I approach code and story as the same challenge:  
→ Build structure from ambiguity.  
→ Make meaning visible.  
→ Translate complexity into clarity.
